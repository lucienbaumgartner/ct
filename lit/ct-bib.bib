	abstract = {Although a great deal of attention has been paid to how conspiracy theories circulate on social media, and the deleterious effect that they, and their factual counterpart conspiracies, have on political institutions, there has been little computational work done on describing their narrative structures. Predicating our work on narrative theory, we present an automated pipeline for the discovery and description of the generative narrative frameworks of conspiracy theories that circulate on social media, and actual conspiracies reported in the news media. We base this work on two separate comprehensive repositories of blog posts and news articles describing the well-known conspiracy theory Pizzagate from 2016, and the New Jersey political conspiracy Bridgegate from 2013. Inspired by the qualitative narrative theory of Greimas, we formulate a graphical generative machine learning model where nodes represent actors/actants, and multi-edges and self-loops among nodes capture context-specific relationships. Posts and news items are viewed as samples of subgraphs of the hidden narrative framework network. The problem of reconstructing the underlying narrative structure is then posed as a latent model estimation problem. To derive the narrative frameworks in our target corpora, we automatically extract and aggregate the actants (people, places, objects) and their relationships from the posts and articles. We capture context specific actants and interactant relationships by developing a system of supernodes and subnodes. We use these to construct an actant-relationship network, which constitutes the underlying generative narrative framework for each of the corpora. We show how the Pizzagate framework relies on the conspiracy theorists’ interpretation of “hidden knowledge” to link otherwise unlinked domains of human interaction, and hypothesize that this multi-domain focus is an important feature of conspiracy theories. We contrast this to the single domain focus of an actual conspiracy. While Pizzagate relies on the alignment of multiple domains, Bridgegate remains firmly rooted in the single domain of New Jersey politics. We hypothesize that the narrative framework of a conspiracy theory might stabilize quickly in contrast to the narrative framework of an actual conspiracy, which might develop more slowly as revelations come to light. By highlighting the structural differences between the two narrative frameworks, our approach could be used by private and public analysts to help distinguish between conspiracy theories and conspiracies.},

They also have many phenomenological features in common, including heightened tendency to attribute negative outcomes to malevolent agents and idiosyncratic pattern detection. Nevertheless, paranoia and conspiracy thinking also differ in key respects. Specifically, paranoid thoughts tend to be held in isolation and involve perceptions of harm to the self. Conspiracy beliefs, on the other hand, are shared by others and involve the perception of collective rather than personal harm. We discuss the similarities and differences between paranoia and conspiracy thinking and outline fruitful avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {In 2005, the concept truthiness was coined by Stephen Colbert, host of the popular satire show, The Colbert Report. Truthiness has been referred to as truth that comes from guts and not from facts and is defined as “the belief in what you feel to be true rather than what the facts will support.” The concept took hold. In 2006 it was declared word of the year by the Merriam-Webster dictionary. It was used particularly and critically in reference to the political scene of the conservative right in the USA at that time. Before Breitbart, the conservative right rallied around Fox News, whose biased news coverage was satirized by The Colbert Report. The show’s critical satire focused on how, especially in the conservative right wing and for then President Bush, it often was enough that something felt like it was true in order to be accepted as such. And not only in the conservative right wing may gut feeling replace truth; this is a universal human phenomenon. The phenomenon of truthiness may find support in cognitive psychology. Through experiments cognitive psychology has demonstrated just how much political bias matters when selecting information and accepting it as true or rejecting it as false.},

	abstract = {Talk about fiction is pretty common in the literature on conspiracy theories. Many have argued that we live in a “post-truth age” in which the boundaries between fiction and reality get easily confused; conspiracy theories, on these views, are fictions that somehow take over our lives, coming to play a hypertrophic role in them. Even though this way of speaking is common, however, it has never been carefully scrutinised. The aim of this chapter is to do that, seeking to clarify whether and to what extents the characterisation of conspiracy theories in terms of fiction is appropriate, and what are its implications for the phenomenon of conspiracism more in general. The author argues that conspiracy theories do indeed qualify as fiction in at least one broad sense of the term—the one famously defined by Kendall Walton, based on the notion of make-believe. Many cases of conspiracy theories’ endorsement can indeed be described in terms of games of make-believe in which such theories are used as props, thereby qualifying as “walt-fictions”. Some important consequences of this view for the question of conspiracy theories’ epistemic rationality are discussed to conclude.},

	abstract = {Philosophers have always been interested in conspiracies, but the philosophical debate on conspiracy theories is a pretty recent phenomenon. Karl Popper wrote about the ‘conspiracy theory of society’, but his discussion concerned issues of intentional explanations in general rather than conspiracy theories proper. This chapter explains how philosophy could help studying conspiracy theories. It focuses on approaches that represent ‘analytical’ philosophy rather than ‘continental’ philosophy. Examples of conspiracy theories include claims that deal with issues such as the death of Princess Diana, the origin of A.I.D.S. and the truth of 9/11. The concept of conspiracy theory is commonly used in a pejorative sense. Philosophers disagree about whether conspiracy theories should be distinguished from ordinary social explanations that refer to conspiracies. Some philosophers have suggested that all the explanations that refer to conspiracies should be called ‘conspiracy theories’ Conspiracy theorising is a form of human action and is thus an appropriate object of ethical evaluation.},

Whilst both these phenomena are widely discussed in the recent psychological literature, however, the relationship between them has not been the object of much explicit attention. In this paper, I argue that this relationship is actually very close, and deserves indepth consideration. I argue that superstitious and confabulatory attitudes share several key features and are rooted in the same psychological mechanisms. Moreover, some of the key features that superstitious and confabulatory attitudes share reveal such attitudes to be non-doxastic in nature, with important implications for our assessment of their epistemic rationality. Many instances of what we call superstitious and confabulatory ‘beliefs’ are not, in fact, beliefs; hence, entertaining them may be less irrational than it prima facie seems to be.},

Keeley, Charles Pigden, Kurtis Hagen, Lee Basham, and the like have argued ‘No!’ I will argue that there are features of certain conspiracy theories which license suspicion of such theories. I will also argue that these features only license a limited suspicion of these conspiracy theories, and thus we need to be careful about generalising from such suspicions to a view of the warrant of conspiracy theories more generally. To understand why, we need to get to the bottom of what exactly makes us suspicious of certain conspiracy theories, and how being suspicious of a conspiracy theory does not always tell us anything about how likely the theory in question is to be false.},
